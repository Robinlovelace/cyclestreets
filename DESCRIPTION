Description: This package provides an R interface to the cycle routing/data services provided by CycleStreets.net,
  a not-for-profit social enterprise and advocacy organisation.
  The APIs provided by CycleStreets.net are documented at (<https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/>).
  The focus of this package is the journey planning API, which aims to emulate the routes taken by a knowledgeable cyclist.
  An innovative feature of the routing API of its provision of 'fastest', 'quietest' and 'balanced' profiles.
  These represent routes taken to minimise time, avoid traffic and comprimise between the two, respectively.
